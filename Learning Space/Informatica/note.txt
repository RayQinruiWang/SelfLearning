Informtica powercenter components:
admin console, repository manager, design tool, integration tool, monitor tool, fairly independent like Putty tools
Access control model: e.g. leader admin, somebody read only, somebody r/w
Source can be db, xml, comma seperated flat file. Informatica provides options to pre-process non-table files
Source -> PowerCenter(everything except console) -> DW -> app
Each project could have multiple repositories, for each team
Naming convention: case sensitive, no spaces for repositories; start with "m_" and no spaces for mapping, "wf_" for workflow

Designer:
Source Analyzer -> target designer -> mapping designer
Source analyzer only load metadata
When a mapping is created, all data is converted into Informatica standard
Join can only take two input table, and input/output port can be specified
Autolink can link fields based on name or positions
When mapping is saved, it is validified as well
Transformation can be stored in a file so it is reusable, mapping can be reused with mapplet designer

workflow:
Create one so you have a start point, add a session and add your designed mapping
Mapping is only a model of how data should be mapped, source/output file path is configed in session properties

workflow monitor:
Whenever a a workflow is executed, workflow monitor is launched. 
Source Target Statistics are very important to visually see if things are reseanoable
