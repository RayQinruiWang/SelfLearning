<ul>
    <li>AWS supports most DB you know, but try to push people to use Aurora</li>
    <li>Aurora has 6 read replica, Amazon SQL engine</li>
    <li>RDB has two key features, Multi AZ and read replica</li>
    <li>Multi AZ only deal with DNS address, not IP, like LoadBalancer</li>
    <li>Read replica doesn't help to ensure integrity, just help with performance, can have 5 max</li>
    <li>NoSQL: you want to use dynamoDB (is it just a JSON DB?), it scales as you go</li>
    <li>For BI: you want to use Redshift(For DW, not as production DB complicated query)</li>
    <li>Elastic mapreduce: Big data framwork, chops dataset and process</li>
    <li>DMS(Database migration service) should be used for migrating an existing db</li>
</ul>
