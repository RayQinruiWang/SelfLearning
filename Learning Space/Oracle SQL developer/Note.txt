If the result of a query is too long, Ctrl + End will stopping it from populating
set pagesize 100 will limit page size too
Autocomplete feature can be configured in preference/code editior page
Ctrl + Up and Down for rotating history queuries
Ctrl + Z works in worksheet
F8 for queuries history, can use filter to find out specific old queuries
Queury builder: drag box, click output fields, specify order, filter, etc and it will build sql
Can add a new "document type group" and view documents side by side. use the split for the same effect too
In the metadata page, you can generate sql DDL script to carry the data schema anywhere
There's option to import/export from or to text file(delimited) and excel file
Reusable script can be stored under function, and can be debugged and compiled prior to excution(use compile for debug)
Can add breakpoint to debug sql code, like other IDEs
Can run part of the script by simplly highlighting(selecting)

Magical table "dual" can be used for hello world even you don't have a database.
Only cap keywords
do not use '' if literely selecting the columns
Constrains: (Called attribute too, can be at column or table level, protects from invalid insert)
    Primary Keys are always not null and unique, so use NOT NULL UNIQUE constrains make sense
    Foreign key: primary key range of another table, primary key for a child table, not necessarily point to a PK, can be any unique constrained column
    Foreign key does not have to be unique, and does not have to be not null(possible but will be warned), but they do need matching type
    Check: give a boolean expression, like a filter
    Unique: literely
    Default: technically not a constrain, but works similarly
Constrains can be packaged into a name. Often it's add all together to the end of table creating script like another column, like 
    'CONSTRAINT user_pk PRIMARY KEY(user_id)'
    'CONSTRAINT project_user_fk FOREIGN KEY (creator) REFERENCES users (username)'
ON DELETE gives the option to imply what to do when deleting something that has dependency: SET NULL(works for none null), CASCADE(when parent is deleted, child is deleted), SET DEFAULT 
Design a multi to multi relationship: use an intermedia table like users_project or project_users, normally it should be a cascade delete as they are helper tables
When multiple columns are passed into primary key definition, the combination of the two is used as primary key
INDEXing the columns that used most frequently: 
    CREATE (UNIQUE) INDEX project_creator_ix ON projects (creator);

DataTypes:
CHAR takes 50 bytes by default, VARCHAR2 and NVARCHAR2 are variable with a cap limit, in VARCHAR2(30 CHAR), if not specified, it will be 30 Bytes
ASCII vs Unicode(UTF-8 and UTF-16), ASCII has 127 -> 255 chars, UTF-8 and UTF-16 are variable in length, in incremental or 1 byte or 2 bytes
UTF-16 does not always cost more spaces, depends on the encoding, sometimes UTS-8 takes 3 bytes on something UTF-16 only need 2 bytes. It works better with Java and .Net.
UTF-8 is a superset of ASCII so it's easier to converte ASCII to UTF-8.
CHAR has a range 1 - 2000 byte, You can specify 2000 Char but you're under a huge risk of running into runtime error. VARCHAR2 allows 4000 bytes, bigger than that we need LOB(Large object)
Oracle can only assign a data set to database level, not table/column level. However, you can make a column type Nchar so it accepts a different DataTypes
But try to have a unicode database(UTF-8) if possible, it doesn't necessarily uses more space, only use NCHAR for existing ASCII database for example
UTF-8 with AL32UTF8 encoding is the most common, you might want to use AL16UTF16(default for NCHAR, which is the fixed length VARCHAR) with UTF-16 when dealing with asian chars
percision in number is the total number of digits, and the scale is the digits after 
DATETIME actually passes in as a string, which follows a certain convention, date is '2019-01-01', time(6) is '22:22:22.XXXXXX'(in 24 hour time, up to 6 digits in scale)
